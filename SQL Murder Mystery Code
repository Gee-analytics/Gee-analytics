Using the first information, I would try to query the crime database for the 
SELECT *

FROM 

crime_scene_report

WHERE type = 'murder' AND city LIKE '%SQL%' AND date = 20180215 ;






1. Crime details 
SELECT *
FROM crime_scene_report
Where type LIKE "%Mur%" AND City = 'SQL City';

date	type	description	city
20180215	murder	REDACTED REDACTED REDACTED	SQL City
20180215	murder	Someone killed the guard! He took an arrow to the knee!	SQL City
20180115	murder	Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".	SQL C


Step 2
--- Checking the personal details of both withnesses 



SELECT id,
       name,
       address_number,
       address_street_name
FROM person
WHERE (name LIKE "Annabel%"
       AND address_street_name IN
         (SELECT address_street_name
          FROM person
          WHERE address_street_name LIKE "Frank%"))
  OR (address_street_name LIKE "%North%"
      AND address_number =
        (SELECT MAX(address_number)
         FROM person
         WHERE address_street_name LIKE "Northwest%"));



*** optional code to get Morty Schapiro
SELECT id,
       name,
       MAX(address_number) AS House_Number,
       address_street_name
FROM person
WHERE address_street_name LIKE ("%Northwestern%");

SELECT id, name, address_number as House_Number, address_street_name
FROM person
ORDER BY address_number DESC
LIMIT 1;


out put
id 	name	MAX(address_number)  StreetName 
14887 Morty Schapiro	4919	Northwestern Dr

**** Optional code to get Annabel
SELECT id,
       name,
       address_number AS House_Number,
       address_street_name
FROM person
WHERE name LIKE '%Anna%'
  AND address_street_name LIKE '%Frank%';


#Output
id	name	address_number    StreetName 
16371 Annabel Miller	103	Franklin Ave


Step 3
Now that I have basic information of the both witnesses, I will take a look at the transcript of their interview

SELECT p.name,
       i.transcript
FROM person p
JOIN interview i ON p.id = i.person_id
WHERE p.id = 14887
  OR p.id = 16371;



Alternative
SELECT p.name,
       i.transcript
FROM person p
JOIN interview i ON p.id = i.person_id
WHERE p.id = 16371;

result
name	transcript
Annabel Miller	I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.

*** Also check out Schapiro's transcript.
SELECT p.name, i.transcript
FROM person p
JOIN interview i
ON p.id = i.person_id
WHERE p.id = 14887;

result:
name	transcript
Morty Schapiro	I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".


Both witnesses have provided information and the common denominator is the Gym with useful information like membership number and Car plate number ! useful clue!


Step 4
Now lets Confirm the gym membership of our suspect based on witness statement.
SELECT id,
       person_id,
       name,
       membership_status
FROM get_fit_now_member
WHERE id Like "%48Z%"
  AND membership_status Like "%Gold%";

Yup we are getting closer to the truth as we are down to just 2 suspect:

membership_id	person_id	name	membership_status
48Z7A	28819	Joe Germuska	gold
48Z55	67318	Jeremy Bowers	gold




Step 5 On the date the crime occured, did this two member show up at the gym?
 
SELECT chk.membership_id,
       g_fit.membership_status,
       g_fit.name,
       chk.check_in_date,
       chk.check_in_time,
       chk.check_out_time
FROM get_fit_now_check_in chk
JOIN get_fit_now_member g_fit ON chk.membership_id = g_fit.id
WHERE (chk.membership_id Like '%48Z7A%'
       OR chk.membership_id Like '%48Z55%')
  AND chk.check_in_date = 20180115;

Well, unfortunately the database didnt return any data - meaning either both suspect didnt show up to the gym or showed up but some how failed to check in.

Lets dig further.

No data returned

Step 6 
Since we have Narrowed down our suspect to 2, lets use the information we have on them to for further digging by joinig, 3 tables, get_fit_now, person and from the drivers_licence table:
other info from drivers license

SELECT g.id AS membership_id, g.person_id, g.name, g.membership_status, 
p.license_id, 
d.plate_number
FROM get_fit_now_member g
JOIN person p
ON g.person_id = p.id
JOIN drivers_license d
ON p.license_id = d.id
WHERE g.id Like "%48Z%" 
AND (p.name Like "%Joe%" OR p.name Like "%Jer%") 
AND d.plate_number LIKE "%H42W%";


OutPut
membership_id	person_id	name	membership_status	license_id	plate_number
48Z55	67318	Jeremy Bowers	gold	423327	0H42W2


Yup Jeremy Bowers is the Godmann Keeeler, Modara !



Now Let's find the Mastermind !


Congrats, you found the murderer! But wait, there's more... If you think you're up for a challenge, 
try querying the interview transcript of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime. 
If you feel especially confident in your SQL skills, try to complete this final step with no more than 2 queries. 
Use this same INSERT statement with your new suspect to check your answer.


Step 7
Lets check for the Modara's interview's transcript

SELECT p.id,
       p.name,
       i.transcript
FROM person p
JOIN interview i ON p.id = i.person_id
WHERE i.person_id = 67318;

Result:
id	name	transcript
67318	Jeremy Bowers	I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). 
She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.


Step 8:  Cross reference key information in Jeremyâ€™s confession across multiple tables. 


SELECT p.id, p.name,
i.annual_income,
f.event_name, f.date AS event_date,
d.age, d.gender, d.height, d.hair_color, d.car_make, d.car_model
FROM person p
JOIN drivers_license d
ON p.license_id = d.id
JOIN income i
ON p.ssn = i.ssn
JOIN facebook_event_checkin f
ON p.id = f.person_id
WHERE d.hair_color IS 'red'
AND f.event_name LIKE '%Symphon%'
AND d.gender IS 'female'
AND d.car_make LIKE 'Tesla%'
AND d.car_model Like '%s%';


Result:
id	name	annual_income	event_name	event_date	age	gender	height	hair_color	car_make	car_model
99716	Miranda Priestly	310000	SQL Symphony Concert	20171206	68	female	66	red	Tesla	Model S
99716	Miranda Priestly	310000	SQL Symphony Concert	20171212	68	female	66	red	Tesla	Model S
99716	Miranda Priestly	310000	SQL Symphony Concert	20171229	68	female	66	red	Tesla	Model S
