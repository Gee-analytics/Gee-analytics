# SQL Murder Mystery Solution

Hey SQL enthusiasts! Welcome to my solution for the SQL Murder Mystery game, where SQL isn’t just about SELECT statements — it’s about unleashing your inner detective, armed with SQL, critical and creative thinking skills.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find my step-by-step solution to cracking the SQL Murder Mystery. The game involves solving a crime by querying a relational database, and I've documented the process from delving into the police department’s database to unveiling the mastermind behind the murder.
